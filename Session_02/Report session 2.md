## Objectives:
To understand how to use Java packages and access classes from different packages using `import`.

---

## Theory/Concept:
- Packages in Java are used to group related classes.
- You can access classes from other packages using:  
  ```java
  import packageName.ClassName;
  ```
- This helps organize large Java projects and avoids class name conflicts.
- Classes from different packages can be compiled and executed together.

---

## Algorithm:
1. Create separate packages like `p1`, `p2`, and `p1.p3`.
2. Write one class in each package with a method printing a message.
3. In the `App.java` (main class), import these classes.
4. Create objects of those classes and call their methods.
5. Compile all `.java` files together.
6. Run the `App` class.

##  Sample Output:
(No input required from the user)

**Expected Output:**
```
Hi from MyClass in package p1  
Hi from Class2 in package p2  
Hi from Class3 in package p2  
Hi from Class4 in package p1.p3
```

##  Observation:
- Classes from different packages compiled and ran successfully.
- `import` statements allowed access to classes from other packages.
- Java's package structure helped organize the code effectively.

##  Conclusion:
Using packages in Java improves project structure and modularity.  
This practical demonstrated how to:
- Create multiple packages,
- Use `import` to access external classes,
- And run a multi-package project successfully.
